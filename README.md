Google Stock Price Prediction

This repository contains a Python script for predicting Google's stock prices using historical data. 
The project uses machine learning techniques, and the code is designed to run in Google Colab. 
There are two datasets included, which are used for training and testing the model.

üßë‚Äçüíª Project Overview

This project aims to predict the stock prices of Google based on historical data using machine learning models. 
The code leverages datasets containing historical stock price information to train the model and predict future stock prices.
Datasets:

    Dataset 1: [https://github.com/Bud10/google_stock_prediction/blob/master/Google_Stock_Price_Train.csv/Description]
    This dataset contains historical stock prices of Google, including features like Open, Close, Volume, etc.

    Dataset 2: [Google_Stock_Price_Test.csv/Description]
    This dataset contains additional data, which shows the real future stock price of google that help in testing the stock price predicted by the model.

üîß Requirements

    Python 3.x
    Google Colab (for running the script in the cloud)
    Required Python libraries:
        numpy
        pandas
        matplotlib
        sklearn
        tensorflow or keras (for deep learning models)

The necessary packages will be installed automatically in Google Colab when running the notebook.
üöÄ How to Use
1. Open the Google Colab Notebook:

    Click on the notebook file in the repository or open it directly in Google Colab using the following link:
    Google Colab Notebook

2. Upload the Datasets:

    Download the datasets from this repository:
        dataset_1.csv
        dataset_2.csv
    Upload the datasets to your Colab environment.

3. Run the Notebook:

    Follow the instructions in the notebook to load the data, preprocess it, and train the model.
    You'll be using machine learning techniques like linear regression, LSTM, or other algorithms depending on your implementation.

4. Predict Stock Prices:

    Once the model is trained, you can use it to predict future stock prices for Google.
    You can visualize the predictions and compare them with the actual values in the dataset.
